# growcontrol
It is a project to control how to grow different plants with arduino.

I'm working with atom https://atom.io and the plugin PlatfomrIO https://platformio.org for running arduino.

You can observe two different folders:

	- lib: All the necessary libraries for running GrowControl in arduino or atom.
	- scr: The main.cpp is the brain. Open this.

But if you prefer to open the whole project in atom, you can click platformio.ini. Then connect your arduino mega and upload.
