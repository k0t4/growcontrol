# growcontrol
It is a project to control how to grow different plants with arduino.

I'm working with atom https://atom.io and the plugin PlatfomrIO https://platformio.org for  run arduino.

You can observe two different folder:
	- lib: All the libraries necessary for run GrowControl in arduino or atom.
	- scr: The main.cpp is the brain. Open this.

But if you prefer open all project in atom, you can click platformio.ini. Then connect your arduino mega and upload.
